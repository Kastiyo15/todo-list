# Todo List
A more advanced project where I used HTML, CSS, SASS and JavaScript to create a simple functional to do list.
Followed a tutorial by Tyler Potts [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eFwtaZf6zc&t), but tried to add extra functionality.
- Sorted the items in the list, so completed items show at the bottom of the list
- Added working filters for 'completed' and 'incomplete' and 'total'
- Checked to make sure the text entered was valid and not ' ', otherwise send an alert()
